# Speeding up LaTeX
This is an informal talk I presented to my friends at the Physics Graduate Student Association(PGSA) at Drexel University on Fall 2019.

I talk briefly about what might be causing the LaTeX typesetting speeding to be slow and possible ways to counteract them and speed up.

The slides do not contain a lot of info, I mostly gave demonstration to try to elucidate what I meant.
